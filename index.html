				<p>It was Dawn and the <span class="sun">SUN</span> had just dipped below the mountain where my ancestors has been living for centuries.</p>
				<p>The <span class="sun">SUN</span> moved down and its beams reflected off the banisters of our family’s tree house. The <span class="sun">SUN</span> reflected off the spiral staircase, which is very big, leading up to the central meeting chamber where the family convenes sometimes</p>
				<p>The <span class="sun">SUN</span> beam reflected rainbow colors because at dawn sometimes the sun does that here, which is just below the mountain.</p>
				<p>It was almost nine, according to the tall wooden grandfather clock that my mom and dad told me was passed down to us by our ancestors. This clock actually was brought down, like the <span class="sun">SUN</span>, from the mountain. We call it the “grandfather clock.”</p>

				<p>It was dawn when the sunbeam finally moved and its path was broken, meaning I could no longer see the numerals “nine.” It was then nighttime in that moment, as I couldn’t see any longer what the clock meant. Overall, there was a slight breeze, and a moment ago, in the central meeting chamber where my family sometimes convenes, I thought I saw the grandfather clock.</p>
				<p>I guess not. In general, the numbers spelled out the <span class="time">TIME</span>, but at dawn, the banisters sometimes reflect the <span class="sun">sun</span> from above the mountains I’ve heard so much about from my family. This is because the mountain, like my <span class="ancestors">ANCESTORS</span>, moved down, like the <span class="sun">SUN</span> slowly from above the horizon.</p>
				<p>It was <span class="time">TIME</span>.</p>
